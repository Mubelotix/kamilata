# Kamilata: A Peer-to-Peer Search Engine System

## Abstract

A purely peer-to-peer version of a search engine would allow indexing and searching of data without the need of relying on a central database. Such a system would be more robust and resilient to attacks, and would be more resistant to censorship. Moreover, it would feature high-level privacy and security guarantees. In this repository, we present a proof-of-concept for Kamilata: a nice and simple protocol making such utopia at last possible.
